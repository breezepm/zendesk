# Breeze

Create Breeze tasks from Zendesk tickets.

### Description
Breeze is a simple visual tool for project management . It shows you what's being worked on, who's working on what, where things are in the workflow and how much time it took. Breeze is simple on the surface, but has everything you need to get work done - tasks, to-dos, time tracking, estimates, budgets, files, calendars, reports and more. If you don’t already have an account, sign up  at https://www.breeze.pm

Now it's easier to share tasks between Breeze and Zendesk. Once the Breeze App is enabled through the Zendesk App Marketplace, simply open a ticket and the Breeze widget will appear to the right. From there, you can add the ticket to an existing task, or create a new one. You can choose the project, list and the task where the ticket will be added. 

### How to install
Installation of the Breeze App is simple. Go to the Apps Marketplace under the Admin panel in Zendesk. Find the Breeze App and click the Install button.

Once you’ve installed the App, navigate to a ticket, click Apps on the top-right, and you should see the Breeze App. If you are not logged in to the Breeze web app, you are asked to log in.

Zendesk agents must be logged in to Breeze with their own accounts to use the App.
